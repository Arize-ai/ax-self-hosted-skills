# Authoring Guidelines for AI Agents

## Skill files are read by AI, not humans

Skill files (SKILL.md, references/, etc.) are loaded as context for AI agents. Follow these rules when editing them, per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

- **Use Markdown links for every file and doc reference** — write `See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md)`, not a bare path or URL. This is the syntax in the spec's File references example; standardize on it repo-wide for consistency. Keep the target a relative path from the skill root, one level deep (e.g. `references/EXAMPLES.md`), and avoid deeply nested reference chains. (Runnable commands and code stay literal — `scripts/extract.py` in a run instruction, `go get …`, code blocks — they are commands, not links.)
- **Additional documentation goes in `references/`** — supplementary docs (e.g., `ax-profiles.md`, `ax-setup.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`) belong in the `references/` subdirectory, per the Agent Skills specification.
- **Keep `SKILL.md` focused** — the full body loads on activation; the spec recommends staying under ~5000 tokens / 500 lines and moving detail into `references/`.
